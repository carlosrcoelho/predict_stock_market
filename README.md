**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict the price of the S&P 500 stock market index using machine learning techniques.

**Project Steps**

1. **Data Acquisition**
    - Utilize the `yfinance` package to download historical data of the S&P 500 stock market index.

2. **Initial Model Creation and Evaluation**
    - Build an initial machine-learning model using the acquired data.
    - Estimate the model's accuracy and performance metrics.

3. **Backtesting Engine Development**
    - Develop a robust backtesting engine to more accurately evaluate the model's performance.
    - Employ the engine to measure accuracy, considering various periods and potential market conditions.

4. **Model Enhancement for Improved Accuracy**
    - Refine and enhance the machine learning model based on insights from the backtesting results.
    - Implement feature engineering, parameter tuning, or model selection techniques to improve predictive accuracy.
